Build Note 11/15
Lot of changes!
-the attendance class has been created. we can now point out our missing students!
-All things that are made inside of a course, like creating a workgroup and adding students are now saved with all students data. the informations are permanent!
-now we can fully rebuild class from its file: attendance.csv and marks.csv

what for next week:
-as we can rebuilt an entire course with its files, we are going to create a programme that can generated every course that has been created
so far with help of its files. this will alow us to manage all the course we want and their students inside  inside our school!
-if possible, creation of the final interface.
